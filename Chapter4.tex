\section*{Conclusions}

Our approach introduces static and dynamic, variants for up to 11.78\% of the programs in our three corpora, increasing the original count of programs by $4.15$ times. We highlighted the importance of complementing static and dynamic studies for programs diversification. Moreover, combining function variants in multivariant binaries makes virtually impossible to predict which variant is executed for a given query. We empirically demonstrate the feasibility and the application of automatically generating \wasm program variants.

% While our approach targets \wasm environments, previous works have demonstrated the importance of execution path randomization \cite{davi2015isomeron}. The work of Davi \etal proposed to randomly switch between two program executions, the original and a variant to provide an unpredictable behavior.
