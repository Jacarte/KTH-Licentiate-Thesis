\chapter{Background \& State of the art}
\label{chapter:sota}

This chapter discusses the state of the art in the areas of \emph{\wasm} and \emph{Software Diversification}. In \autoref{sota:wasm} we discuss the \wasm language, its motivation, how \wasm binaries are generated, the language specification, and security-related issues. In \autoref{sota:sota}, we present a summary of Software Diversification, its foundational concepts and highlighted related works.  
We select the discussed works by their novelty, critical insights, and representativeness of their techniques. 
In \autoref{sota:openchallenges}, we finalize the chapter by highlighting open challenges in state-of-the-art related works.


%In \autoref{sota:wasm} we describe the context in which this dissertation is based, \wasm. We include both usage scenarios for Wasm and its main security issues. In \autoref{sota:diversification} we discuss the main diversification techniques in the wild, we introduce the concept of superoptimization used in this work, and we end the section by highlighting superdiversification as the cornerstone of our contributions are based. In \autoref{sota:randomization} we mention close works to runtime diversification and how diversification can be used to construct resilient binaries.

\subsection*{Conclusions}
In this chapter, we presented the background on the \wasm language, including its security issues and related work.
This chapter aims to settle down the foundation to study automatic diversification for \wasm. 
We highlighted  that \wasm has been less researched in the field of Artificial Software Diversification. 
On the other hand, current available implementations for Software Diversification cannot be directly ported to Wasm. 
The current limitations on security and the lack of software diversity approaches for \wasm motivate our work.
We place our contributions in the field of artificial diversity. 
In \autoref{chapter:technical} we describe the technical details that lead our contributions. 
Besides, the impact of our contributions is evaluated by following the methodology described in \autoref{chapter:method}.
