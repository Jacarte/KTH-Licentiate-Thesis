\chapter{Background \& State of the art}

This chapter discusses state of the art in the areas of \emph{\wasm} and \emph{Software Diversification}. In \autoref{sota:wasm} we discuss the \wasm language, its motivation, how \wasm binaries are generated, language specification, and security-related issues. In \autoref{sota:sota}, we present a summary of Software Diversification, its foundational concepts and highlighted related works.  
We select the discussed works by their novelty, critical insights, and representativeness of their techniques. 
In \autoref{sota:novelty}, we finalize the chapter by stating our novel contributions and comparing them against state-of-the-art related works.


%In \autoref{sota:wasm} we describe the context in which this dissertation is based, \wasm. We include both usage scenarios for Wasm and its main security issues. In \autoref{sota:diversification} we discuss the main diversification techniques in the wild, we introduce the concept of superoptimization used in this work, and we end the section by highlighting superdiversification as the cornerstone of our contributions are based. In \autoref{sota:randomization} we mention close works to runtime diversification and how diversification can be used to construct resilient binaries.

\subsection*{Conclusions}
In this chapter, we presented the background on the \wasm language, including its security issues and related work.
This chapter aims to settle down the foundation to study automatic diversification for \wasm. 
We highlighted related work on Artificial Software Diversification, showing that it has been widely researched, not being the case for \wasm. 
On the other hand, current available implementations for Software Diversification cannot be directly ported to Wasm. 
We placed our contributions in the field of artificial diversity. 
In \autoref{chapter:technical} we describe the technical details that lead our contributions. 
The results of our contributions are obtained by following the methodology described in \autoref{chapter:method}.
