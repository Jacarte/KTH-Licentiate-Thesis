\chapter{Background \& State of the art}

This chapter discusses state of the art in the areas of \emph{\wasm} and \emph{Software Diversification}. In \autoref{sota:wasm} we discuss the \wasm language, its motivation, how \wasm binaries are generated, language specification and security related issues. In \autoref{sota:sota}, we present a summary of Software Diversification and its foundational concepts. In addition, we compare and locate our contributions againts state of the art related works.  
We select the discussed works by their novelty, critical insights and representativeness of their used techniques. 
We finalize the chapter by stating our novel contributions. 


%In \autoref{sota:wasm} we describe the context in which this dissertation is based, \wasm. We include both usage scenarios for Wasm and its main security issues. In \autoref{sota:diversification} we discuss the main diversification techniques in the wild, we introduce the concept of superoptimization used in this work, and we end the section by highlighting superdiversification as the cornerstone of our contributions are based. In \autoref{sota:randomization} we mention close works to runtime diversification and how diversification can be used to construct resilient binaries.

\subsection*{Conclusions}
In this chapter we presented the background on the \wasm language including our motivation on its security issues and related work enforcing its security.
Software Diversification has been widely researched, not being the case for \wasm. In this chapter, we aim to settle down the foundation to study automatic diversification for \wasm. We stated our contributions to the field of artificial diversity by extending current state of the art. 
Our contributions are obtained by following the methodology described in \autoref{chapter:method}.
