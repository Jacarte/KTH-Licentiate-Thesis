\section*{Conclusions}

This chapter discusses the technical details for the artifacts implemented for our two contributions.
We describe how CROW generates program variants.
We introduce a new mutation strategy that is a consequence of retargeting a superoptimizer for LLVM as a superdiversifier.
Besides, we dissect MEWE and how it creates an MVE system.
In \autoref{chapter:method} we discuss the methodology we follow to evaluate the impact of CROW and MEWE.
