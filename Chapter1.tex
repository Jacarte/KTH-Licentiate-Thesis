% From Web 1.0 to JavaScript and how it support full-fledge applications
The first web browser, Nexus \cite{nexus}, appeared in 1990.
At that moment, web browsing was only about retrieving and showing small and static HTML web pages, \ie potential users read the content of pages without interactions further requesting a specific page.
The growing computing power of devices, the spread of the internet, and the need for more interaction and experiences for users encourage the idea of executing code along with web pages.
The Netscape browser made possible the execution of code on the client-side with the introduction of the JavaScript \cite{10.1007/978-3-642-14107-2_7} language in 1995.
Remarkably, all browsers have supported JavaScript since Netscape. 
Nowadays, most web pages include not only HTML, but also include JavaScript code that is executed in client computers.
The web browser is in charge of interpreting JavaScript in the user machine.
During the past decades, web browsers have become JavaScript language virtual machines, virtually evolving as operating systems that can run full-fledged applications, like video and audio players, animation creators, and PDF document renderers such as the one showing this document.



% Javascript problems
JavaScript is currently the most used scripting language in all modern web browsers \cite{mulazzani2013fast}. 
However, JavaScript faces several limitations related to the characteristics of the language. For example, any JavaScript engine requires the parsing and the recompilation of the JavaScript code, which implies a significant overhead.
Moreover, JavaScript faces security issues \cite{10.1145/1190216.1190252}.
For example, JavaScript lacks of memory isolation, making possible to extract pieces of information from others processes \cite{10.1145/3412841.3442001}.
%Besides, due to the dynamicity of JavaScript, cross-scripting is possible \cite{10.1145/3184558.3188736} 
Because of these problems, the Web Consortium (W3C) standarized a bytecode for the web environment with the \wasm (Wasm) language in 2017 \cite{Haas_2017}. 
\wasm becomes the fourth official language for the web with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

% Describe WebAssembly
Wasm is designed to be fast, portable, self-contained, and secure \cite{Haas_2017}.
All \wasm programs are compiled ahead-of-time from source languages such as C/C++ and Rust.
\wasm is created by third-party compilers that might include optimizations like in the case of LLVM.  
The \wasm language defines its Instruction Set Architecture \cite{wasm_spec} as an abstraction close to machine code instructions but agnostic to CPU architectures. Thus,  web browsers can use it to rapidly compile to the target architectures. %Therefore, \wasm outperforms JavaScript in the browser.

WebAssembly is faster than JavaScript \cite{Haas_2017}. Moreover, recent works demonstrate that using WebAssembly as an intermediate layer is better in terms of startup and memory usage than containerization and virtualization \cite{pMendkiServerless, 1244493Jacobsson}. 
Consequently, in 2019, the Bytecode Alliance \cite{bytecodealliance} proposed WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) \cite{WASI}. 
WASI standarized the execution of \wasm outside the browser with a POSIX system interface platform.
WASI standarizes the adoption of \wasm in heterogeneous platforms \cite{bryant2020webassembly}, making it suitable for edge-cloud computing platforms \cite{9640153, wen2020wasmachine}
WASI standarized a POSIX protocol to execute Wasm directly in the operating system. 
To give an example of the importance of this evolution of \wasm, let us use the exact words of Solomon Hykes, the former CEO of docker: 
"\textit{If WASM+WASI existed in 2008, we wouldn't have needed to created Docker. That's how important it is. Webassembly on the server is the future of computing. A standardized system interface was the missing link. Let's hope WASI is up to the task!\footnote{\url{https://twitter.com/solomonstre/status/1111004913222324225}}}"

\section{Software Monoculture}
% Monoculture
Web browsers and JavaScript have nearly three decades of development.
Since then, web browsers have grown, reaching 12 different implementations \cite{grosskurth2005reference, GARCES2021111004}. 
Nevertheless, only Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Edge dominate the presence on user computers.
This means that, for 5 arbitrary devices (computers, tablets, smartphones) in a world of millions, at least two of them use the same web browser.
This highlights a software monoculture problem \cite{goth2003addressing}, as an ecosystem of machines running the exact same software. 
The monoculture concept is an analogy from biology \cite{lala2009monoculture}. It describes an ecosystem that face extinction due to lack of diversity as all individuals share the exact same vulnerabilities.


Nowadays, the serving of web pages, including WebAssembly code, is centralized and served through main sources.
Thus, a similar argument for software monoculture can be used for the \wasm code that is served to web browsers. 
Despite being designed for sandboxing and secure execution, \wasm is not exempt from vulnerabilities \cite{WebAssemblySecurity}.
For example, \wasm engines are vulnerable to speculative execution \cite{Narayan2021Swivel}, and C/C++ source code vulnerabilities might be ported to Wasm binaries \cite{DeRoover2022}.  
Therefore, the sharing of the \wasm code through web browsers, also includes \wasm vulnerabilities.


% Escalating
The software monoculture problem escalates if we consider the edge-cloud computing platforms and how they are adopting Wasm to provide services, as we previously mentioned.
Concretely, thousands of edge devices running the Wasm as backend services, thus not only client devices might be affected through web browsers due to vulnerabilities sharing.
This means that if one node in an edge network is vulnerable, all the others are vulnerable in the exact same manner as the same binary is replicated on each node. In other words, the same attacker payload would break all edge nodes at once.
This illustrates how Wasm execution is fragile with respect to systemic vulnerabilities for the whole internet, like it happened on June 8, 2021, for Fastly \cite{BREAKFastly}.

One might think that the solution is to adopt more web browser and interpreters implementations. 
However, this is virtually impossible as 4 web browsers dominate the market, thus, a solution in this address is doomed to fail. 
Another solution is to provide different WebAssembly codes as soon as they are requested from the internet. 
For example, a different source code, yet equivalent, can be provided when a web page is served \cite{CROW}. 
Consequently, millions of computers would execute different codes even though they use the same web browser.
This strategy is called Software Diversification.
% Monoculture and diversification motivation, 
 
\section{Software Diversification}

Software Diversification is the process of finding, creating, and deploying program variants for a given original program \cite{okhravi2013survey} for the sake of security.
Cohen \etal \cite{cohen1993operating} and Forrest \etal \cite{595185} pioneered this field by proposing software diversification through code transformations. 
They proposed to produce variants of programs while preserving their functionalities to not be vulnerable.
Since then, transformations aiming at reducing the predictability of observable behavior of programs have been proposed. For example, works on this direction proposed to diversify programs control flow \cite{davi2015isomeron}, instruction set \cite{barrantes2003randomized}, or the system calls they use \cite{Chew02mitigatingbuffer}. 
Several of these transformations can be combined to produce less predictable variants.

Previous works on software diversification demonstrated the removal of vulnerabilities, but remarkably in all cases, it can be used as a preemptive solution.
For example, if a vulnerability is present in one program variant, discovering and disseminating it will not affect other variants.
Software diversification has been widely researched, not being the case for \wasm.
In this field, only Romano \etal \cite{wobfuscator} proposed the intermixing JavaScript and Wasm function calls to provide obfuscation against code analysis. 
For \wasm, no software diversification solution has been proposed, primarily due to its novelty.



\section{Artificial Software Diversification for \wasm}


We port, for \wasm, the code transformations proposed in previous works as a preemptive software diversity solution.
Since the majority of the Wasm binaries are created by the LLVM pipeline \cite{Hilbig2021AnES}, we propose a novel approach to generate software diversification for \wasm through the LLVM pipeline.
We create a general approach to make code analysis for Wasm code in-between the LLVM compilation process.
In addition, we create several \wasm variants by transforming their intermediate LLVM representation.
Moreover, we combine \wasm program variants in multivariant execution binaries, that are able to execute different, yet semantically equivalent, computations in worldwide internet platforms.


\section{Research questions}
\label{intro:definition:rq}

Three main research questions conduct our work.
In this section, we present them. 
Our research questions are formulated by merging our publications and experiences during the creation of Software Diversification for WebAssembly. 


\begin{enumerate}[label=\subscript{RQ}{{\arabic*}}]
    \item \textbf{\rqone}\\
    With this research question, we quantitatively assess the static differences between program variants created by our approach. We answer this question at the population level, where a program population is the collection of one original program and its generated variants. We aim to investigate the code properties that increase(or diminish) diversification at population level. 

    \item \textbf{\rqtwo} \\
    With this research question, we complement $RQ_1$. We aim to investigate the impact on execution traces and execution times of the generated program variants.

    \item \textbf{\rqthree} \\
    %\todo{Intro motiv}
    With this research question, we aim to investigate the impact of Software Diversification for WebAssembly in an emerging technology, edge-cloud computing. We evaluate the impact of a novel multivariant execution approach on real-world WebAssembly programs in a world-wide scale experiment.
    
    
\end{enumerate}


\renewcommand{\rqone}{$RQ_1$. To what extent can we artificially generate program variants for WebAssembly?}

\renewcommand{\rqtwo}{$RQ_2$. To what extent are the generated variants dynamically different?}
\renewcommand{\rqthree}{$RQ_3$. To what extent do the artificial variants exhibit different execution times on edge-cloud platforms?}

\section{Contributions}

This thesis contributes through four milestones. First, as a \emph{theoretical contribution}, we summarize the code transformations used to generate artificial software diversification through an exhaustive literature review. Consequently, we highlight the lack of diversification techniques for WebAssembly.
Second, as a \emph{technical contribution}, we provide two tools, CROW \cite{CROW} and MEWE \cite{MEWE}. CROW creates 
Wasm program variants by retargeting a superoptimizer \cite{Sasnauskas2017Souper:Superoptimizer}.
MEWE merges several Wasm program variants in a multivariant execution schema \cite{okhravi2013survey}.
In addition, we summarize the main challenges faced during their implementation, such as i) program properties that make it prone to generate more variants and ii) program properties that make the observable behavior of variants different. 
Besides, we discuss the incorporation of \emph{constant inferring} as a new transformation. 
Third, we propose a \emph{methodology} to quantitatively evaluate the impact of our tools, assessing the creation of artificial software diversification for WebAssembly. 
Fourth and final, we \emph{empirically demonstrate} the impact of our technique by evaluating the static and dynamic behavior of the generated diversity.
Our results show that creating software diversification  for \wasm is feasible. 
Remarkably, our diversification approaches remarkably affect the observable behavior such as static program properties, execution traces and execution times.

    %\textbf{Abstract:} The adoption of WebAssembly has rapidly increased in the last few years as it provides a fast and safe model for program execution. However, WebAssembly is not exempt from vulnerabilities that could be exploited by side channels attacks. This class of vulnerabilities that can be addressed by code diversification. In this paper, we present the first fully automated workflow for the diversification of WebAssembly binaries. We present CROW, an open-source tool implementing this workflow. We evaluate CROW's capabilities on 303 C programs and study its use on a real-life security-sensitive program: libsodium, a cryptographic library. Overall, CROW is able to generate diverse variants for 239 out of 303,(79\%) small programs. Furthermore, our experiments show that our approach and tool is able to successfully diversify off-the-shelf cryptographic software (libsodium).}
    \item Multi-Variant Execution at the Edge \cite{MEWE}\\
    {\small\textbf{Javier Cabrera-Arteaga}, Pierre Laperdrix, Martin Monperrus, Benoit Baudry}\\
    \emph{Under review}
    %{\small
    %\textbf{Abstract:} Edge-cloud computing offloads parts of the computations that traditionally occurs in the cloud to edge nodes,e.g., CDN servers, in order to get closer to the users and reduce latency. To improve performance even further, WebAssembly is increasingly used in this context. Edge-cloud computing providers, such as Fastly or Cloudflare, let their clients deploy stateless services in the form of WebAssembly binaries, which are then translated to machine code and sandboxed for a safe execution at the edge.
    %In this context, we propose a technique that (i) automatically diversifies WebAssembly binaries that are deployed to the edge and (ii) randomizes execution paths at runtime, turning the execution of the services into a moving target. Given a service tobe deployed at the edge, we automatically synthesize functionally equivalent variants for the functions that implement the service.All the variants are then wrapped into a single multivariant WebAssembly binary. When the service endpoint is executed,every time a function is invoked, one of its variants is randomly selected. We implement this technique in the MEWE tool and we validate it with 7 services for cryptography and QR encoding. MEWE generates multivariant binaries that embed hundreds of function variants. We execute the multivariant binaries on the worldwide edge platform provided by Fastly. We show that,at runtime, the multivariant exhibit a remarkable diversity ofexecution traces, across the whole edge platform. }
