\rqone

The main motivation for this research question is that \wasm was adopted in 2017, and it lacks of natural diversity \citationneeded. Moreover, compared to the work of Harrand \etal \citationneeded, in WebAssembly, we cannot use preexisting and different programs to provide diversification. In fact, according to the work of Hilbig \etal \citationneeded, the artificial variants created with one of our works contributes to the half of executable and available \wasm binaries in the wild.
