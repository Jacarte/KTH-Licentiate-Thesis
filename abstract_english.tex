% Birth
\wasm has become the fourth official web language, along with HTML, CSS and JavaScript since 2019. 
WebAssembly allows web browsers to execute existing programs or libraries written in other languages, such as C/C++ and Rust.
In addition, \wasm evolves to be part of edge-cloud computing platforms. 
% Problems
Despite being designed with security as a premise, \wasm is not exempt from vulnerabilities. 
Therefore, potential vulnerabilities and flaws are included in its distribution and execution, highlighting a software monoculture problem.
On the other hand, while software diversity has been shown to mitigate monoculture, no diversification approach has been proposed for \wasm. 
This work proposes software diversity as a preemptive solution to mitigate software monoculture for \wasm.


Besides, we provide implementations for our approaches, including a generic LLVM superdiversifier that potentially extends our ideas to other programming languages.
We empirically demonstrate the impact of our approach by providing Randomization and Multivariant Execution (MVE) for \wasm. 
Our results show that our approaches can provide an automated end-to-end solution for the diversification of \wasm programs. 
The main contributions of this work are:

\begin{itemize}


    \item We highlight the lack of diversification techniques for WebAssembly through an exhaustive literature review.
    
    \item We provide the implementation of two tools, CROW and MEWE, providing randomization and multivariant execution for \wasm. 


    \item We include constant inferring as a new code transformation to generate software diversification for \wasm.

    \item We empirically demonstrate the impact of our technique by evaluating the static and dynamic behavior of the generated diversification.
    
\end{itemize}
 
Our approaches harden observable properties commonly used to conduct attacks, such as static code analysis, execution traces, and execution time.
%Therefore, our approaches harden \wasm against unknown and yet-unknown vulnerabilities.
